# Mini Prima Database Seeding - Execution Guide

## 🎯 Complete E2E Database Setup for Testing

This guide ensures successful database seeding with real authentication integration for comprehensive E2E testing.

### 📋 Prerequisites Verification

1. **Supabase Project**: Ensure your project is set up and accessible
2. **Authentication Users**: Verify these users exist in Supabase Auth:
   ```
   ✅ admin@davilareisadvogados.com.br (ID: 18625a22-61cd-48e2-9518-1a9827197bef)
   ✅ lawyer1@davilareisadvogados.com.br (ID: d052ddde-47fe-44f9-8bf5-f9edbe134dde) 
   ✅ client1@empresa.com.br (ID: 02c51375-adac-4e68-8129-8b0ec52f07b9)
   ✅ client2@corporacao.com.br (ID: 3cf021fa-08a1-430d-ac2a-8b692ceab9cb)
   ✅ client3@startup.com.br (ID: b0c045d2-ad49-4bb2-a6c1-362921580ff5)
   ```

### 🚀 Step-by-Step Execution

#### Step 1: Run Schema Migration (First Time Only)
```bash
psql "postgresql://postgres:your-password@your-supabase-host:5432/postgres" -f fix-schema-migration.sql
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✅ SCHEMA MIGRATION COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY!
✅ All critical columns have been added or verified
✅ Database schema is now compatible with seed script
🚀 YOU CAN NOW RUN THE SEED SCRIPT SUCCESSFULLY!
```

#### Step 2: Execute Seeding Script

**Option A: Complete Fresh Seeding (empty database)**
```bash
psql "postgresql://postgres:your-password@your-supabase-host:5432/postgres" -f seed-database-complete.sql
```

**Option B: Safe Seeding (database with existing data)**
```bash
psql "postgresql://postgres:your-password@your-supabase-host:5432/postgres" -f seed-database-safe.sql
```

**Expected Output:**
```

### ⚠️ Troubleshooting

#### **Schema Issues**
If you encounter column errors:
1. Ensure `fix-schema-migration.sql` ran successfully first
2. Check that all foreign key relationships are established  
3. Verify Row Level Security policies are not blocking inserts

#### **Fixed Issues in Latest Version**
- ✅ **documents.uploaded_by type mismatch**: Fixed conversion from varchar to UUID with proper validation
- ✅ **Column name alignment**: Updated to use existing column names (document_name, case_title)
- ✅ **Foreign key constraints**: Properly handles existing data during type conversion
- ✅ **client_status enum values**: Fixed mapping from registration_status to valid client_status values:
  - `pending/under_review` → `Inactive`
  - `approved` → `Active`  
  - `rejected` → `Terminated`
- ✅ **staff table structure**: Fixed to match actual database schema:
  - `specialization` as JSON array instead of string
  - Added required `position`, `start_date`, `status` columns
  - Proper `staff_status` enum values ("Active", "Inactive", "On Leave", "Terminated")
- ✅ **duplicate key conflicts**: Created safe seeding version that handles existing data:
  - Checks for existing records before inserting
  - Preserves existing data while adding new test records
  - Uses conditional inserts with NOT EXISTS clauses
- ✅ **subscription_plans schema mismatch**: Fixed missing required columns:
  - Added required `tier` column ('basic', 'professional', 'enterprise')
  - Added required `category` column ('labor_law', 'corporate_law', 'full_service')
  - Changed `price` to `monthly_price` to match schema
  - Updated both safe and complete seeding scripts
- ✅ **case_status enum type mismatch**: Fixed invalid status values:
  - Replaced 'active'/'completed' with proper case_status enum values
  - Added explicit `status::case_status` type casting in SELECT clause
  - Updated status values: 'In Progress', 'Closed - Won', 'Waiting Court', 'Open'
  - Fixed both safe and complete seeding scripts
- ✅ **priority enum type mismatch**: Fixed invalid priority values:
  - Replaced lowercase values with proper priority enum values
  - Added explicit `priority::priority` type casting in SELECT clause
  - Updated priority values: 'Low', 'Medium', 'High', 'Urgent' (capitalized)
  - Fixed both safe and complete seeding scripts
- ✅ **invalid UUID format errors**: Fixed malformed UUID strings:
  - Replaced invalid patterns like 'supplier1-1111-1111-1111-111111111111'
  - Updated all supplier, expense category, bill, case, and invoice UUIDs to proper format
  - Fixed 35+ invalid UUIDs across both safe and complete seeding scripts
  - All UUIDs now comply with PostgreSQL UUID v4 standard

#### **Authentication Issues**
If admin_users insert fails:
1. Verify the auth user IDs exist in `auth.users` table
2. Check that the UUIDs match exactly (case-sensitive)
3. Ensure users have confirmed their email addresses

#### **Performance Issues**
If seeding is slow:
1. The script includes 400+ records across 15+ tables
2. Expected completion time: 30-60 seconds
3. Check database connection stability

### 🎯 Database Seeding Status: ✅ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

**Latest Status (June 20, 2025)**: The safe database seeding script has been successfully applied with all schema compatibility issues resolved.
