## Revolutionary Hybrid Legal-as-a-Service Business Model

### Advanced Billing System Architecture
The system implements a sophisticated hybrid revenue model combining traditional legal billing with subscription services:

```typescript
// Multi-Revenue Stream Architecture
interface HybridBillingSystem {
  // Traditional Case Billing
  caseBilling: {
    hourlyRate: number;           // R$/hour by staff level
    percentageRate: number;       // % of case total value
    fixedFee: number;            // Predetermined amount
    minimumFee: number;          // Per case type minimum
    successFee: {               // Êxito - percentage of recovery
      percentage: number;
      minimumRecovery: number;
      maximumFee: number;
    };
    paymentPlans: {             // Split payments into N installments
      installments: number;
      interestRate: number;
      downPayment: number;
    };
  };
  
  // Subscription Revenue Streams
  subscriptions: {
    laborLawConsulting: number;    // Monthly compliance consulting
    corporateLawConsulting: number; // Business legal advisory
    contractReviewService: number; // Document analysis quota
    legalHelpdesk: number;         // Unlimited legal questions
    templateAccess: number;       // Legal document library
    complianceMonitoring: number; // Regulatory updates
  };
  
  // Intelligent Cross-Selling Engine
  discountEngine: {
    subscriptionTier: 'basic' | 'professional' | 'enterprise';
    litigationType: string;
    discountPercentage: number;   // Automatic calculation
    crossSellConversion: number;  // Subscription to litigation rate
  };
}
```

## Development Guidelines

### Code Standards
- **Naming Convention**: Use snake_case for database fields, camelCase for TypeScript
- **File Organization**: Group by feature, not by type
- **Component Structure**: Prefer composition over inheritance
- **Database**: Always use UUID for primary keys, include created_at/updated_at

### Security Requirements
- **Row Level Security**: All tables must have RLS policies
- **Data Isolation**: Staff can only access assigned clients
- **Audit Trails**: Log all significant actions for compliance
- **File Security**: Signed URLs for document access

### Brazilian Localization
- **Language**: All UI text in Portuguese (Brazil)
- **Currency**: Real (R$) formatting with proper decimals
- **Dates**: DD/MM/YYYY format
- **Phone**: Brazilian phone number formatting
- **CPF/CNPJ**: Brazilian tax ID validation and formatting

## Development Workflow

### Git Commit Guidelines
- **NO Claude signatures**: Never include "Generated with Claude Code" or Co-Authored-By
- **Descriptive messages**: Focus on business value, not technical details
- **Feature branches**: Create branches for each major feature
- **Small commits**: Commit frequently with focused changes

### Testing Strategy
- **Unified Test Center**: Single comprehensive testing interface (`test-unified-center.html`)
- **Optimized Testing**: Minimal test versions (`test-crud-minimal.html`) for performance
- **Multi-Portal Testing**: Admin, Staff, Client, Website, Financial, Banking, Database, Core CRUD
- **Real-time Test Tracking**: Live statistics, logs with filtering, export functionality
- **Core CRUD Testing**: Complete document, case, and client management workflow testing
- **Performance Testing**: Browser optimization for large test suites (3700+ lines)
- **Database Testing**: Use Supabase migrations with proper rollback procedures
- **Integration Testing**: Test all API endpoints and database operations
- **Banking Integration Testing**: PIX, Boleto, Account info, Certificate validation
- **User Acceptance Testing**: Validate with actual legal workflows

### Development Priorities
1. **Revenue Generation**: Billing and time tracking features first
2. **Compliance**: Deadline management and audit trails
3. **User Experience**: Intuitive interfaces for daily legal work
4. **Integration**: Brazilian court and banking system connections
